      <h2>What I've Done</h2>
      <p>
        As a <strong>reporter</strong>, I built environment and energy beats at two public radio stations. In two coal-reliant regions, my reporting highlighted the
        effects of lawmakers’ inactions on coalfield residents.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an <strong>editor</strong>, I’ve worked with students, staff reporters, and freelancers from concept to publication, across news, podcasts, and investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a <strong>newsroom leader</strong>, I led large teams at Louisville Public Media, launching a weekly show, creating award-winning podcasts, and managing
        coverage of a historic pandemic and racial justice protests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Currently</strong>, since June 2024, I’ve been working with newsrooms across the country to help them create local voter guides and access free election resources through a grant from the Knight Foundation. I’m an editor-at-large for Mountain State Spotlight, digital managing editor for 100 Days in Appalachia, and a contract editor for the Future Today Institute.
      </p>
      <p>
        I live outside Louisville, Kentucky with my husband and two sons.
