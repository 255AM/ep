      <h2>What I've Done</h2>
      <p>
        As a <strong>reporter</strong>, I built environment and energy beats at two public radio stations: West Virginia Public Broadcasting and Louisville Public Media. In two places where the 
        energy and economy was reliant on coal, my years of reporting revealed the real-world effects of lawmakers’ inactions on coalfield residents.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an <strong>editor</strong>, I’ve worked with students, staff reporters and freelancers from concept to publication on everything from spot news to podcasts to investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a <strong>newsroom leader</strong>,  I led the large local, regional and investigative team at 
        Louisville Public Media. During my time as Director of News and Programming, my team launched a weekly show, created multiple award-winning podcasts and catapulted 
        ourselves into becoming a main source of news for local residents through our coverage of a historic pandemic and racial justice protests. Later, at Mountain State Spotlight 
        in West Virginia, I built an audience and membership program from the ground up, crafted coverage plans, launched new products and managed the reporting staff.

        <strong>Currently</strong>, I’m wearing lots of hats. Since June 2024, I’ve been working with newsrooms across the country to help them create local 
        voter guides and access free election resources through a grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. (Read some of the coverage of that 
        initiative <a href="https://rjionline.org/news/key-questions-to-consider-when-building-voter-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >here</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.ire.org/product/ire-journal-q3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >here</a>). I’m an editor-at-
        large for <a href="https://mountainstatespotlight.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Mountain State Spotlight,</a> 
        and the digital managing editor for <a href="https://www.100daysinappalachia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >100 Days in Appalachia. </a>
        I’m also a contract editor for <a href="https://futuretodayinstitute.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Future Today Institute,</a> working to make sure their annual Trend Report is clear, accurate, and accessible to readers around the world.

        I live outside Louisville, Kentucky with my husband and two sons.
